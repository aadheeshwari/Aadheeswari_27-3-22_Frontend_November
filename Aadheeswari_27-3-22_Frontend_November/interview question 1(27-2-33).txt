1) What is a pure component?
       

     In simple words, If the previous value of state or props and the new value of state or props is the same, the 
component will not re-render itself. Since Pure Components restricts the re-rendering when there is no use of re-rendering 
of the component. Pure Components are Class Components which extends React.
